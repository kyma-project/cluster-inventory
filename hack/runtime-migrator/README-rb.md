# Runtime Backuper

The `runtime-backup-and-switch` application
1. connects to a Gardener project
2. retrieves all existing shoot specifications
3. for each runtime on input list:
  a) gets shoot, Cluster Role Bindings and OpenIDConnect resources 
  b) saves the backup on a disk
  c) marks Cluster Role Bindings that were created by the Provisioner with `kyma-project.io/deprecation` label
  d) switches the runtime to be controlled by KIM by setting `kyma-project.io/controlled-by-provisioner` label with `false` value

## Build

In order to build the app, run the following command:

```bash
go build -o ./bin/runtime-backup-and-switch ./cmd/backup
``` 

## Usage

### Dry run
```bash
./bin/runtime-backup-and-switch \
  -gardener-kubeconfig-path=/Users/myuser/gardener-kubeconfig.yml \
  -gardener-project-name=kyma-dev  \
  -kcp-kubeconfig-path=/Users/myuser/kcp-kubeconfig.yml \
  -output-path=/tmp/ \
  -dry-run=true \
  -input-file-path=input/runtimeIds.txt \
  -input-type=txt
```

The above **execution example** will:
1. take the input from the `input/runtimeIds.txt` file (each raw contains single `RuntimeID`)
1. proceed only with fetching `Shoot`, `Cluster Role Bindings` and `OpenIDConnect` resources
1. save output files in the `/tmp/<generated name>` directory. The output directory contains the following:
    - `backup-results.json` - the output file with the backup results

### Backup and switch Runtime to be controlled by KIM

```bash
./bin/runtime-backup-and-switch \
  -gardener-kubeconfig-path=/Users/myuser/gardener-kubeconfig.yml \
  -gardener-project-name=kyma-dev  \
  -kcp-kubeconfig-path=/Users/myuser/kcp-kubeconfig.yml \
  -output-path=/tmp/ \
  -dry-run=false \
  -input-file-path=input/runtimeIds.txt \
  -set-controlled-by-kim=true \
  -input-type=txt
```

The above **execution example** will:
1. take the input from the `input/runtimeIds.txt` file (each raw contains single `RuntimeID`)
1. proceed with fetching `Shoot`, `Cluster Role Bindings` and `OpenIDConnect` resource
1. save output files in the `/tmp/<generated name>` directory. The output directory contains the following:
    - `backup-results.json` - the output file with the backup results
    - `backup` - the directory with the backup files
1. label Cluster Role Bindings that were created by the Provisioner
1. switch Runtime to be controlled by KIM

```

The backup results are saved in the `backup/results/backup-2025-01-10T09:27:49+01:00/backup-results.json` file.

The `backup-results.json` file contains the following content:
```json
[

    "runtimeId": "a774bae2-ed8b-464e-85cc-ab8acd4461d5",
    "shootName": "c-35a9898",
    "status": "Success",
    "backupDirPath": "backup/results/backup-2025-01-10T09:27:49+01:00/backup/a774bae2-ed8b-464e-85cc-ab8acd4461d5",

    "status": "Error",
    "errorMessage": "Failed to fetch shoot: shoot was deleted or the runtimeID is incorrect",

]

```
The above example The runtime with the `exxe4b14-7bc2-4947-931c-f8673793b02f` identifier was not found ; the identifier may be incorrect, or the corresponding shoot was deleted for some reason.

The `backup/results/backup-2025-01-10T09:27:49+01:00/backup/a774bae2-ed8b-464e-85cc-ab8acd4461d5` directory contains the following:
- `c-35a9898-original.yaml` file
- `c-35a9898-to-restore.yaml` file
- `crb` folder
- `oidc` folder

The `c-35a9898-original.yaml` file contains the differences between the original shoot and the shoot that will be created based on the new Runtime CR. The `c-35a9898-to-restore.yaml` file contains the shoot that will be created based on the new Runtime CR. The `original-shoot.yaml` file contains the shoot fetched from the Gardener.
The `crb` directory contains the yaml files with Cluster Role Bindings that refer to `cluster-admin` role. The `oidc` folder contains yaml files with `OpenIDConnect` resources
